### Useful refactoring tool in Eclipse
The **rename**-function automatically renames all references of a renamed field, method, or class name. When refactoring, renaming these is useful if they do not have a concise name or their usage/functionality has changed. In general, the usage of concise names makes code easier to read. The code also speaks for itself, which makes additional (non-javadoc) comments superflous. This tool can be used by pressing **ALT** + **SHIFT** + **r**.
